/**
 * Verification result cache.
 *
 * A token is bound to one hostname and reused by the extension for the whole of its life, so a busy
 * site sees the same 232 characters on every request from a returning visitor. Verifying it once and
 * remembering the answer turns a 74us pair of curve operations into a map lookup.
 *
 * Failures are cached alongside successes, and for the same reason: a forged or replayed token costs
 * exactly as much to reject as a real one costs to accept, and an attacker who is going to retry is
 * going to retry with the same bytes. Caching a negative is safe because, for a fixed public key, no
 * rejection can later turn into an acceptance - the only direction a verdict can move is valid to
 * expired, which the entry's own expiry already handles.
 *
 * Only verdicts that actually cost cryptography are stored. A malformed token is rejected in about a
 * microsecond by a length check, so caching one would buy nothing while letting anybody who can send
 * requests fill memory with distinct junk keys.
