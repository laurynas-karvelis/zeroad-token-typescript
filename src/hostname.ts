/**
 * Hostname canonicalisation.
 *
 * The extension binds a token to the hostname exactly as it appears in the address bar, lowercased and
 * without the port. A publisher gets the same string back from `req.headers.host`, `c.req.header("host")`
 * or `new URL(request.url).hostname` depending on the stack, in varying shapes, so both sides normalise
 * the same way before the hostname is fed to a signature.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately *not* normalised here: `www.example.com` stays distinct from
 * `example.com`. A token is bound to whichever of the two the visitor had in the address bar, and the
 * signature is verified against that exact string - collapsing them here would make a token bound to
 * one verify against the other. The convenience of not having to list both hosts is handled one level
 * up, on the whitelist (see `wwwVariants`), where it changes only which hosts are admitted, never what
 * a signature is checked against.

 * Publishers routinely serve both the apex and its `www` and reasonably expect listing one to cover the
 * other - forgetting the second is a common way to lock real subscribers out. Since the two are the
 * same registrable domain under the same owner, the whitelist admits both when either is configured.
 * This affects membership only: the token is still verified against the exact host the request arrived
 * on, so a token bound to `www.example.com` is admitted on `www.example.com` and nowhere else.
